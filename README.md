# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Classwork

This repository contains classwork for my Data Structures and Algorithms class at Rowan University.

It includes various custom data structures coded as an exercise while learning how those specific structures work.
It also includes implementations of simple algorithms like Max and Fibonacci.
